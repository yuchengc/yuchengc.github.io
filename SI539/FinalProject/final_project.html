	<h1>Review website : https://events.umich.edu/</h1>
	<h3>My role : Designer</h3>
	<br>	
	<h3>Make sure there is enough contrast between text and its background color</h3>
	<p>Yes</p>
	<p> Overall, this website applies good contrast between text and the background. It uses the light font color with bark background and dark font color with the light background. Users can easily read the content. But it uses blue-green text with a dark-grey background at some part. This combination is not clear enough for users.</p>

    <h3>Don't indicate important information using color alone</h3>
    <p>Yes</p>
    <p>Overall, this site uses color to highlight the title and important information. But it doesn't use other ways, such as underline and larger size, to emphasize the content. Also, it uses the bold style for most of the test. This design will also reduce the readability of the important information.</p>

    <h3>Pair values of colors together (not only hues) to increase contrast</h3>
    <p>Yes</p>
    <p>This site does a great job in this part. it use complementary color to enhance the contrast</p>

    <h3>Don't rely on sensory characteristics as the sole indicator for understanding and operating content</h3>
    <p>Yes</p>
    <p>This site uses some squares and block to construct the layout and navigates users to click the blocks for further information. It doesn't rely on sensory characteristics. </p>

    <h3>Design focus states to help users navigate and understand where they are</h3>
    <p>Yes</p>
    <p>This site allows users to use "tab" to focus and select items. But, in the event list, this website doesn't use the hover effect. Thus, users might not notice where they are easily.</p>

    <h3>Help users understand inputs and help them avoid and correct mistakes</h3>
    <p>Yes</p>
    <p>For its search bar, it provides a hint, "search" text, for users and educates users that they could type something here. After users type some words, the web will provide auto-match content for your to speed up the search process. It is a good design and is efficient.</p>

    <h3>Write good alt text for your images</h3>
    <p>Yes</p>
    <p>In this site, images has alt text.</p>

    <h3>If an experience cannot be made accessible, create another route for users to get that information</h3>
    <p>Yes</p>
    <p>It provides an auto-play slideshow at the top of the page. For the slideshow, when the content is hidden, users still can use the right-side menu to switch and access the content.</p>

    <h3>Be as consistent and clear as possible in layout and copy</h3>
    <p>Yes</p>
    <p>For the events list, it provides a format for all event post. However, because events' title is different, the spaces for titles have various size. This design might make the screen messy. But it still keeps each event area equal. </p>
