                    <p>With a busy schedule of working and studying, more and more workers and students choose to eat out rather than cook by themselves. They are frustrated with the flavors, nutrients, and prices of meals provided by restaurants, especially fast-food restaurants. With the consideration of health and the budget, homemade foods are still their favorite. Also, for students and migrants who left their home and traveled to the US, national cuisines are the panacea to motivate and cheer them up.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the U.S, lots of people are good at cooking and they are also willing to share their meals with people. Thus, how to connect the cooks who are happy to share with eager people and build up a fascinating experience of having meals are the major purposes of my design.

                    <h3>Background Research</h3>
                    <h5>Online questionnaire design</h5>
                    <p>In order to understand end-users, people seeking meals and people providing meals, I designed a online questionnaire that collected:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Background information</li>
                        <li>Dining habit</li>
                        <li>Meal sharing or hunting experience</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Based on respondents’ dining habits, I directed them to answer different surveys, cook’s and searcher’s. In the cook’s questionnaire, I collected their reasons for cooking, their sharing experience, and the platforms/channels for communication they used. In the searcher’s questionnaire, I asked them their reasons for eating out, their consideration of purchasing foods, the factors of making decision.</p>
                    <div class="process-images">
                        <img src="img/project_pokemeal/questionnair_result.png" alt="Design Process">
                    </div>

                    <p>According to the online questionnaire, 83% of home cooks (number of samples: 177) have shared and are willing to share their meals with people. And, 63.5% of respondents who select “eating out” as their major dining behavior (number of samples: 74) mention that homemade foods are their favorites. And 52.6% of them mentioned that they have purchased and are willing to purchase homemade food from home cooks. They are busy office workers, international students, and migrants, and they are the people who are eager to have homemade meals. However, currently, these people seeking meals need a platform to connect them with the people who love cooking and are enthusiastic about sharing their dishes.</p>
                    <p>In order to build the connection between people seeking meals and people providing meals, firstly, I need to know what do the people seeking meals do when they are seeking their meal. Moreover, what mechanism should the cooks use for providing their dishes? Also, what issues that home cooks have faced when they shared their meals? Furthermore, I want to understand what are the key factors that influence people seeking meals during the meal hunting.</p>

                    <p>With the knowledge from the observation and competitive analysis, I started brainstorming and proposed several ideas for the meal sharing service. Sketching the ideas allowed me to imaging the scenario and the interaction firstly, no matter how crazy the ideas were. I drew several key ideas on the paper, including ingredients sharing, zero food waste, leftover food from individuals’ homemade meals. With the feedback from course instructors and potential end-users, I narrowed down the ideas and focused on the concept, Pokemon Go.</p>
                    <p>In this idea, meal searching became a game that users could walk through the streets and discover meals. This idea entertains users but loses the efficiency of finding a meal. After considering the feasibility and the entertainment, I decided to extract the pros from the ideas of Pokemon Go and integrate the features of the widely used app to construct my app.</p>

                    <p>I used story mapping to go through the whole service and list all potential touch points between the cooks and meal searchers in my service. I included both the meal searcher and providers, and drew their daily timelines. Through the story mapping, I could have a complete flow of my users’ life and I could point out the potential opportunities in which my application can intervene. In the store mapping, I discovered that the dining time is the perfect time for me to connect the people seeking meals and cooks, especially in the time-limited concept. People seeking meals can obtain the food immediately just after cooks cooked it.</p>

                    <p>The overall structure of my app was ambiguous at the beginning. I tried to clarify all the structure of functions that I should integrate into the system, including the functions for both people seeking meals and cooks. I listed all the functions I want to add firstly. And, I classified similar functions together and built up the hierarchy. The result was a tree diagram and it could help me to adjust the design.
                    </p>
                    <p>With the Questions, Options, and Criteria (QOC) analysis, I listed all potential interactions for each major function and compared their pros and cons. Later, I structured the app.</p>

                    <p>I used the index cards to create the paper prototype and invited potential users to test my design. According to paper prototype testing, end-users could smoothly manipulate most of the interactions. The participants of paper prototype testing gave me a good feedback. However, they also raised the issues related to feedback, confusion about icons and wording, and the placement of some additional information. Thus, I added the following user feedback: on the dining preference page, clicking an item will change their background color. I also adjusted the words to distinguish the ordered meals and shared meals. Based on subjects’ suggestions, I decided to have one more layer for delivering detailed information about each meal. Although an additional layer might reduce the efficiency of manipulation, users still prefer to read more information before they order the meal rather than order that meal directly on the map view.</p>

In order to provide the customized service, users need to enter their dining preferences, their favorite national cuisines, flavors, dietary restrictions and food allergies. Based on users’ different backgrounds, especially international students and migrants, they might prefer different cuisines and love different flavors. Their selections of dining preference will be the default filter which will be applied to the exploration map.</p>

This design can also specifically connect the time-limited meals to near searchers who can pick it up immediately.</p>
